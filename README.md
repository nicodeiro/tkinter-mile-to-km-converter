The NATO alphabet is a phonetic alphabet used to spell out letters and numbers over radio or telephone communication in a way that is clear and unambiguous.

The NATO alphabet assigns a specific word to each letter of the English alphabet and each number from 0 to 9. For example, the word "Alpha" represents the letter "A," "Bravo" represents "B," and so on. This allows for quick and accurate communication, even in noisy or confusing environments.
